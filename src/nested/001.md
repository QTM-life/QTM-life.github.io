# **Module 1: Soil Data Heterogeneity & Standardization Protocols**

Master the challenge of integrating data from wet chemistry, spectroscopy, sequencing, and field sensors. Learn to build data pipelines that handle missing values, measurement uncertainty, and method-specific biases inherent in soil datasets.

This first intensive 15-hour program provides the essential foundation for all subsequent modules in the Foundation Phase, ensuring students can handle the unique challenges of soil data heterogeneity that will recur throughout modules 002-025.  Students are encourage to peruse modules 002-025 or to refer to them for context.

Of course, it would be impossible to study EVERYTHING mentioned in a given time slot -- the objective of each time slot, is to spend all of the time in the deepest dive possible in autodidactic study, using that time to delve as deeply as possible into the given topics mentioned, with an eye to applying the material over the entire course, in order to be as familiar as possible with the content, so that one may readily come back to it as material is applied in future work.
