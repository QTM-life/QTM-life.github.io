# **Module 5: Metagenomic Sequence Processing at Scale**

Build bioinformatics pipelines optimized for soil's extreme diversity. Handle 10TB+ metagenomes, implement quality filtering for high-humic samples, and manage chimeric sequences from complex communities.

The course objective is to build scalable, end-to-end bioinformatics pipelines specifically optimized for the extreme diversity and unique biochemical challenges of soil metagenomes. Students will master techniques to handle terabyte-scale datasets, implement robust quality control for samples with high humic acid content, and manage complex assembly artifacts like chimeric sequences.

This module is a cornerstone of the **Foundation Phase**. It directly follows the establishment of data architecture (Module 2) and spectral processing (Module 4), and provides the clean, annotated biological data required to train powerful foundation models like **SoilMetaGen** and **NitrogenCycler**. Successfully processing this data is fundamental to the vision of transforming soil science from a descriptive to a predictive discipline.

### **Hour 1-2: The Soil Metagenome: A Universe of Challenges** ðŸŒŒ

**Learning Objectives:**
* Understand why soil's microbial diversity is unparalleled and why this creates unique computational problems.
* Identify the major sources of error and bias in soil DNA sequencing.
* Conceptualize the storage and compute requirements for a 10TB+ metagenome project.

**Content:**
* **The "Long Tail" of Diversity**: Soil ecosystems are characterized by a few dominant taxa and hundreds of thousands of rare ones. This extreme diversity leads to fragmented assemblies and makes genome reconstruction incredibly difficult.
* **The 10TB+ Problem**: We'll map out the data lifecycle of a large soil projectâ€”from raw reads (terabytes) to assembled contigs (gigabytes) to annotated genes (megabytes)â€”and discuss the I/O and RAM bottlenecks at each stage.
* **Biochemical Interference**: Focus on **humic acids**, natural polymers in soil that co-extract with DNA. They inhibit PCR enzymes and sequencing reactions, leading to low-quality reads, biased community representation, and failed sequencing runs.
* **The Chimera Problem**: High diversity and PCR amplification can cause DNA fragments from different organisms to incorrectly join, creating artificial "chimeric" sequences that corrupt downstream analysis.

**Practical Exercise:**
* Analyze the metadata and species richness estimates from the Earth Microbiome Project and JGI's IMG/M database.
* Write a script to plot a rank-abundance curve for a soil sample versus a human gut sample to visually demonstrate the difference in diversity.
* Calculate the projected cloud storage and compute costs for a hypothetical 10TB soil metagenomics project.

* **Contaminant Screening**: A systematic process of using **BLAST** or **DIAMOND** to search assembled contigs against databases of common lab contaminants, such as cloning vectors and PhiX (a control used in Illumina sequencing).
* **Assembly Metrics**: Moving beyond simple N50 values to evaluate an assembly's quality using read-mapping validation (how many of the original reads map back to the assembly?).

**Hands-on Lab:**
* Take a raw metagenome assembly and use **VSEARCH** to identify and flag potential chimeric contigs.
* Run a BLAST search against a vector database to find and remove any contigs that are lab artifacts.

    2.  **Domain/Family Search**: Use **HMMER** to search for conserved protein domains in databases like **Pfam**. This can often assign function even when a full-length match isn't found.
* **Pathway Reconstruction**: Mapping annotated genes to metabolic pathway maps (like those in KEGG) to understand the community's collective capabilities (e.g., "Does this soil have the genes for denitrification?").

**Bioinformatics Lab:**
* Use **Prodigal** to predict protein sequences from a set of assembled contigs.
* Annotate the proteins using **DIAMOND** against the **KEGG** database.
