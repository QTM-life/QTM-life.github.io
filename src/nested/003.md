# **Module 3: Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) Integration**

Build APIs to interface with commercial LIMS platforms used by soil testing laboratories. Handle proprietary formats, quality flags, and chain-of-custody requirements for regulatory compliance.

Based on the progression from Module 001 (data heterogeneity) and Module 002 (multi-scale architecture), Module 003: Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) Integration addresses the critical interface between analytical laboratories and data pipelines and provides the crucial bridge between analytical laboratories and the data architecture established in Modules 001-002, enabling seamless integration of high-quality analytical data into the soil data ecosystem required for the foundation models described in the broader curriculum.
