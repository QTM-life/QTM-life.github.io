# **Module 4: Spectroscopic Data Processing Pipelines**

Implement preprocessing for VIS-NIR, MIR, XRF, and Raman spectra. Master baseline correction, peak deconvolution, and spectral library matching specific to soil matrices with high quartz interference.

This module builds directly on the principles of data heterogeneity (Module 1), multi-scale architecture (Module 2), and data ingestion (Module 3). It provides the critical data transformation layer required to convert raw, noisy spectral data into clean, information-rich features for the foundation models to be developed in later phases (Modules 51-75).

**Tasks:**

1.  **Design & Justify**: For each spectral type, design a specific preprocessing pipeline, providing a clear rationale for each chosen step (e.g., "Used ALS for MIR baseline because of complex curvature; used continuum removal for VIS-NIR to normalize organic matter features").
2.  **Implement**: Code the three pipelines using the production-ready techniques from Hour 13-14.
3.  **Extract & Fuse**: Process the raw data and extract meaningful features from each modality (e.g., elemental concentrations from XRF, clay/organic indices from MIR, moisture/iron oxide features from VIS-NIR).
4.  **Create Final Product**: Combine all extracted features into a single Pandas DataFrame, with sample IDs as the index and features as columns, ready for machine learning.

**Deliverables:**

**Assessment Criteria:**

  * Appropriateness and justification of preprocessing choices.
  * Code quality, modularity, and documentation.
  * Successful fusion of data from all three modalities.
  * Clarity and insight in the final report.
