# **13. DormancyDynamics**
This model predicts transitions between active and dormant states in soil microbial communities, forecasting the responsive fraction under changing conditions. It learns triggers for dormancy induction and resuscitation from environmental time series.

Building this requires RNA/DNA ratios to assess activity, BONCAT labeling to identify active cells, and high-frequency environmental monitoring. Few studies track dormancy dynamics over time; most are snapshots. New approaches should combine flow cytometry with viability staining and metatranscriptomics during wetting-drying cycles.
