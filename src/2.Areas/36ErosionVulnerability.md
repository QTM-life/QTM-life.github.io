# **36. ErosionVulnerability**
This model predicts soil loss potential from water and wind erosion at multiple scales, from splash detachment to gully formation. It learns critical thresholds for erosion initiation and sediment transport capacity.

The model requires rainfall simulation data, wind tunnel experiments, and field erosion monitoring using pins, laser scanning, and sediment collection. The National Soil Erosion Research Laboratory has extensive plot data but landscape-scale measurements are limited. Future strategies should deploy UAV-based photogrammetry for high-resolution erosion monitoring across watersheds.
