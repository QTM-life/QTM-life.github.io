# **32. MacroporeFlow**
This model predicts preferential flow through macropores from root channels, earthworm burrows, and cracks, critical for contaminant transport. It learns to identify conditions triggering bypass flow and resulting chemical breakthrough patterns.

The model requires dye tracing experiments, tension infiltration at multiple pressures, and breakthrough curve measurements for conservative tracers. Some lysimeter facilities have detailed datasets but field-scale data is sparse. Future efforts should employ fiber-optic distributed temperature sensing to detect preferential flow in real-time during infiltration events.
