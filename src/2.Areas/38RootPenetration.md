# **38. RootPenetration**
This model predicts root ability to penetrate compacted layers, forecasting rooting depth and architecture under mechanical constraints. It learns critical penetration resistance thresholds for different species and the role of biopores.

Training data needs controlled rhizotron experiments with penetration resistance mapping, root force measurements, and 3D root architecture analysis. Limited data exists linking mechanical properties to root growth. Future collection should use transparent soil with embedded pressure sensors to observe root-soil mechanical interactions.
