# **8. ViralShunt**
This model predicts viral abundance, host range, and impacts on microbial turnover and nutrient cycling in soil, quantifying the "viral shunt" that redirects carbon and nutrients. It learns virus-host relationships from metagenomic data and predicts lysis rates under different conditions.

Training requires virome sequencing paired with bacterial/archaeal community profiling and measurements of cell lysis rates. The IMG/VR database contains soil viral sequences but lacks corresponding host and process data. Future collection should use fluorescent staining and flow cytometry to quantify viral production rates alongside sequencing efforts.
