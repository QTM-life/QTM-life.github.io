### **70. ForestFloorProcessor**
This model forecasts litter decomposition and humus formation in forest soils, predicting nutrient release and organic horizon development. It learns species-specific decomposition rates and interactions with soil fauna.

Building this needs litterfall measurements, decomposition bag studies, and chemical analysis of litter and humus layers. The LIDET network has decomposition data but lacks detailed chemistry. Future collection should use FTIR and NMR to track chemical changes during decomposition with DNA-based identification of decomposer communities.

### **71. GrasslandBuilder**
This model predicts soil carbon accumulation and nutrient cycling under different grassland types and management. It learns how root architecture, fire, and grazing affect soil properties.

Training requires root biomass measurements to depth, soil carbon fractionation, and monitoring under different grazing intensities. The Konza Prairie LTER has extensive data but global grassland coverage is poor. New efforts should use minirhizotrons for continuous root monitoring with isotopic labeling to track root carbon inputs.

### **72. PeatAccumulation**
This model forecasts peat formation rates and carbon storage in wetlands, predicting responses to drainage and climate change. It learns controls on decomposition versus accumulation under waterlogged conditions.

The model needs peat core dating, bulk density profiles, and carbon accumulation rates from different wetland types. The International Peat Society has some data but tropical peatlands are understudied. Future strategies should use ground-penetrating radar for peat depth mapping with multi-proxy analysis of cores.

### **73. MangroveCarbon**
This model predicts blue carbon dynamics in coastal wetlands, forecasting carbon burial and methane emissions from mangrove soils. It learns effects of salinity, tides, and sediment inputs on carbon cycling.

Building this requires sediment accretion measurements, carbon burial rates using ²¹⁰Pb dating, and greenhouse gas monitoring. The Blue Carbon Initiative has mapped extent but process data is limited. New methods should deploy sensor networks for continuous salinity/redox monitoring with sediment traps.

### **74. PermafrostThaw**
This model forecasts active layer dynamics and carbon release from thawing permafrost, predicting tipping points for rapid degradation. It learns thermal-hydrological-biogeochemical feedbacks.

Training data needs borehole temperature monitoring, active layer measurements, and carbon flux monitoring in permafrost regions. The Global Terrestrial Network for Permafrost has temperature data but carbon dynamics are poorly constrained. Future efforts should use electrical resistivity tomography for thaw detection with automated CO₂/CH₄ monitoring.

### **75. FireImpact-Soil**
This model predicts wildfire effects on soil properties including organic matter loss, water repellency, and nutrient availability. It learns recovery trajectories and management effects on resilience.

The model requires burn severity mapping, post-fire soil sampling, and monitoring of vegetation recovery. The Burned Area Emergency Response program has some data but long-term recovery is rarely tracked. New protocols should establish permanent plots with pre-fire baseline data and annual post-fire monitoring.

### **76. LandslideRisk**
This model forecasts slope stability based on soil properties, predicting failure risk under different rainfall scenarios. It learns critical combinations of soil depth, moisture, and slope angle for instability.

Building this needs shear strength measurements, soil depth mapping, and monitoring of slope movement. Geotechnical studies exist but integration with soil properties is limited. Future collection should use InSAR for slope movement detection with in situ monitoring of pore pressure.

### **77. RiparianBuffer**
This model predicts nutrient retention efficiency of riparian buffers, optimizing vegetation and width for water quality protection. It learns subsurface flow paths and biogeochemical hotspots.

Training requires nutrient flux measurements across buffers, water table monitoring, and denitrification rate measurements. The Riparian Ecosystem Management Model has some data but field validation is limited. New strategies should use conservative tracers with high-frequency nutrient monitoring.

### **78. UrbanSoilEvolution**
This model forecasts soil development in urban environments, predicting effects of compaction, contamination, and novel parent materials. It learns trajectories of human-altered soil formation.

The model needs urban soil surveys, contamination assessments, and temporal sampling of greenspaces. NYC Urban Soils Institute has mapped some cities but coverage is limited. Future efforts should establish urban soil observatories with regular monitoring and historical reconstruction.

### **79. MineralWeathering-Landscape**
This model predicts landscape-scale patterns of mineral depletion and soil development from bedrock. It learns how climate, topography, and time control weathering fronts.

Building this requires geochemical mass balance studies, cosmogenic isotope dating, and mineralogical gradients with depth. Critical Zone Observatories have detailed data but are limited to few sites. New methods should use portable XRF for rapid field mapping with targeted sampling for detailed analysis.
