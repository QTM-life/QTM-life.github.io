### **90. RespirometryPredictor**
This model forecasts long-term carbon mineralization from short-term respiration measurements, learning decay kinetics of different carbon pools. It predicts cumulative CO₂ evolution and identifies labile versus recalcitrant fractions.

Building this needs extended incubation studies (months to years) with high-frequency CO₂ monitoring and periodic sampling for property changes. Standard soil tests use short incubations but long-term data for validation is rare. Future protocols should use automated multiplexed systems for parallel long-term incubations under controlled conditions.

### **91. PLFAInterpreter**
This model predicts complete microbial community structure from phospholipid fatty acid profiles, learning associations between biomarkers and taxonomic groups. It estimates biomass, diversity, and functional groups from PLFA patterns.

Training requires paired PLFA analysis and DNA sequencing from the same samples across diverse soils. Commercial laboratories offer PLFA but interpretation varies between providers. New efforts should calibrate PLFA against quantitative PCR and metagenomics, focusing on improving biomarker specificity.

### **92. DNAQuality-Soil**
This model predicts DNA extraction efficiency and sequencing success from soil metadata, learning effects of clay, humic substances, and contaminants. It recommends optimal extraction protocols for challenging samples.

The model needs extraction yield data, DNA quality metrics (260/280, 260/230 ratios), and sequencing success rates linked to soil properties. Microbiome studies encounter extraction problems but systematic documentation is poor. Future collection should benchmark multiple extraction kits across soil types with standardized quality metrics.

### **93. ProximaSensor**
This model integrates data from multiple proximal sensors (EC, pH, temperature, moisture) to create high-resolution soil property maps. It learns spatial correlation structures and uncertainty propagation.

Building this requires co-located sensor measurements with laboratory validation across fields and seasons. Precision agriculture generates sensor data but calibration is site-specific. New strategies should develop universal calibration sets using diverse soils with transfer learning approaches.

### **94. LabToField**
This model scales laboratory measurements to field conditions, learning how sample preparation and storage affect results. It predicts field-relevant values from standard laboratory protocols.

Training data needs paired laboratory and in-field measurements accounting for moisture, temperature, and structure differences. Discrepancies between lab and field results are widely recognized but poorly quantified. Future efforts should use intact soil sensors to benchmark laboratory methods against field conditions.

### **95. SampleOptimizer**
This model predicts optimal sampling strategies for characterizing soil variability, learning efficient designs for different objectives and budgets. It recommends sampling density, depth, and timing for maximum information gain.

The model requires high-density sampling campaigns with geostatistical analysis and cost-benefit evaluation. Limited studies compare sampling strategies systematically. New research should use exhaustive sampling in representative fields to evaluate subsampling strategies.

### **96. ContaminantScreen**
This model rapidly predicts multiple pollutants from a single analytical measurement like XRF or spectroscopy. It learns spectral signatures of heavy metals, pesticides, and organic contaminants.

Building this needs comprehensive contaminant analysis paired with rapid screening methods across contamination gradients. Environmental consulting firms have data but it's proprietary. Future collection should focus on creating public databases of contaminated soil spectra with certified reference materials.

### **97. TextureRapid**
This model predicts complete particle size distributions from simplified measurements like settling time or laser diffraction. It learns to correct for organic matter and dispersion effects.

Training requires parallel analysis by pipette, hydrometer, and laser methods with pretreatment variations. Texture analysis is routine but method comparison is limited. New protocols should systematically compare methods across soil types with standardized pretreatments.

### **98. BioassayPredictor**
This model forecasts plant growth response from soil chemical data without growing plants, learning nutrient interactions and toxicity thresholds. It predicts crop-specific responses from general soil tests.

The model needs greenhouse bioassays paired with comprehensive soil analysis across fertility gradients. Agricultural research has yield data but controlled bioassays are less common. Future efforts should use standardized test plants with multi-element manipulation experiments.

### **99. QualityIndexer**
This model integrates multiple biological, chemical, and physical indicators into unified soil health scores. It learns indicator weights and interactions for different objectives like productivity or carbon storage.

Building this requires datasets with complete soil health measurements and outcome variables like yield or ecosystem services. The Soil Health Institute is developing frameworks but validation datasets are limited. New strategies should link indicator measurements to specific outcomes across management systems.

### **100. CalibrationTransfer**
This model adapts analytical calibrations between different instruments, laboratories, and methods, enabling data integration. It learns systematic biases and develops transfer functions for harmonization.

Training needs ring tests with identical samples analyzed by multiple laboratories using different instruments. Proficiency testing exists but focuses on accuracy not transfer. Future efforts should distribute reference samples globally with centralized database development for model training.
