# **39. GasFlux-Soil**
This model predicts CO₂, N₂O, and CH₄ emissions from soil profiles, integrating production, consumption, and transport processes. It learns how soil structure controls gas diffusion and the formation of anaerobic microsites.

The model requires continuous multi-gas flux measurements using automated chambers, soil gas profile sampling, and corresponding environmental data. FLUXNET sites have CO₂ data but trace gas coverage is limited. New deployments should use quantum cascade laser spectroscopy for simultaneous multi-gas monitoring with depth-resolved sampling.

Integrated measurements and modeling of CO2, CH4, and N2O fluxes using soil microsite frequency distributions provide a predictive tool for quantifying the emissions of carbon dioxide (\(CO_{2}\)), nitrous oxide (\(N_{2}O\)), and methane (\(CH_{4}\)) from soil. It integrates the biological processes of gas production and consumption with the physical processes of gas transport to forecast greenhouse gas fluxes under different environmental conditions. Core functionalities Predicts multiple gas emissions: The model can forecast emissions for key greenhouse gases (\(CO_{2}\), \(N_{2}O\), \(CH_{4}\)) simultaneously. One iteration of the model, for example, successfully predicted future \(CO_{2}\) and \(CH_{4}\) fluxes for a subarctic wet tundra ecosystem, suggesting that warming could enhance its role as a carbon sink.Accounts for soil heterogeneity: It explicitly considers how soil structure influences gas diffusion and the creation of anaerobic microsites. These are small areas within the soil that lack oxygen, which affects the balance of gas production and consumption.Integrates key soil processes: The model builds upon the Dual Arrhenius and Michaelis-Menten (DAMM) model to include functions for individual gas production and consumption processes, alongside standard diffusion calculations for each gas and oxygen (\(O_{2}\)).Incorporates environmental factors: It considers variables like soil temperature, moisture content, and oxygen levels as driving factors for gas production and transport.Utilizes state-of-the-art measurement techniques: The model requires validation using simultaneous, continuous measurements of multi-gas fluxes, often with automated chambers. Advancements in quantum cascade laser (QCL) spectroscopy have enabled the high-precision, real-time multi-gas measurements needed for this kind of modeling. Necessary data inputs To function effectively, the model requires extensive, high-resolution datasets from field deployments. Continuous multi-gas flux measurements: Data is collected at the soil surface using automated chambers to measure the rate of gas exchange.Depth-resolved soil gas profile sampling: Multi-gas concentrations are measured at different depths within the soil profile to understand the production and transport dynamics below the surface. Quantum cascade laser spectroscopy is a key technology for this kind of sensitive, simultaneous measurement.Corresponding environmental data: Concurrent collection of soil temperature, moisture, and other relevant environmental conditions is needed to drive the model and interpret results. Context in ecological research Relationship to FLUXNET: While FLUXNET provides extensive eddy covariance data on \(CO_{2}\) fluxes, its coverage of trace gases like \(N_{2}O\) and \(CH_{4}\) is limited. The GasFlux-Soil model offers a way to expand on FLUXNET data by incorporating more trace gas data from new deployments.Addressing data gaps: The model helps fill the gap in understanding trace gas emissions by providing a framework to interpret and integrate high-resolution data from new deployments, particularly those using advanced QCL spectroscopy.Improving diffusivity estimation: A major source of uncertainty in soil gas models is the estimation of gas diffusivity. GasFlux-Soil requires high-quality diffusivity data, which is often modeled from properties like air-filled pore space. Different models can be used for this, but the choice can significantly impact flux estimates. New deployments and technology To implement the GasFlux-Soil model successfully, new deployments must use advanced technology capable of high-precision, multi-gas measurements. Quantum cascade laser (QCL) spectroscopy: This technology is specified for its ability to monitor multiple trace gases simultaneously with high precision and time resolution. This is particularly useful for measuring small, dynamic changes in gas concentrations from depth-resolved sampling.Automated chambers: Field equipment, such as automated chambers from companies like LI-COR, are used for continuous surface flux measurements. These chambers are designed to minimize disturbance to the soil and maintain ambient pressure, ensuring accurate data collection
