# **31. CrustFormation**
This model predicts surface seal and crust development from raindrop impact and slaking, forecasting reduced infiltration and increased erosion risk. It learns relationships between aggregate stability, rainfall energy, and crust characteristics.

Training needs rainfall simulation experiments with crust strength measurements, microscopic imaging of crust structure, and infiltration monitoring. Limited systematic data exists linking crust properties to formation conditions. New collection should use high-speed photography to capture aggregate breakdown dynamics during rainfall with subsequent micro-CT of crust architecture.
