# **7. QuorumSense-Soil**
This model predicts bacterial communication networks and resulting community behaviors like biofilm formation, antibiotic production, and coordinated enzyme secretion. It learns to identify quorum sensing signals from metabolomic data and predict community-level responses.

The model requires paired metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and metabolomics data with specific focus on acyl-homoserine lactones and other signaling molecules. Few existing datasets comprehensively measure signaling molecules in soil; most research focuses on pure cultures. New data collection should employ solid-phase microextraction coupled with mass spectrometry to detect signaling molecules in soil microsites.
