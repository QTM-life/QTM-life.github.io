# **28. WaterRetention-AI**
This model predicts soil water characteristic curves - the relationship between water content and matric potential - from easily measured properties like texture and organic matter. It learns how aggregate structure and pore geometry affect water retention across the full moisture range.

Training data needs high-resolution water retention curves measured using pressure plates, dewpoint potentiometers, and centrifuge methods, linked to comprehensive soil characterization. The UNSODA database contains retention curves but many lack complete property data. Future collection should use automated systems like HYPROP to generate continuous retention curves while simultaneously measuring hydraulic conductivity.
