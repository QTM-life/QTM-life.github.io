# **23. FungalHighway**
This model predicts bacterial dispersal along fungal hyphae networks, forecasting enhanced degradation of spatially separated pollutants. It learns which bacterial-fungal pairs form effective partnerships for contaminant degradation.

The model requires microscopic tracking of bacterial movement on hyphae, co-inoculation degradation experiments, and network topology analysis. Few studies quantify dispersal rates; most are qualitative observations. New approaches should use microfluidic devices with hyphal networks and fluorescent bacteria to quantify transport rates.
