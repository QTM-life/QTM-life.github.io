# **29. InfiltrationPredictor**
This model forecasts water infiltration rates and patterns under varying initial conditions, rainfall intensities, and surface configurations. It learns to predict preferential flow initiation and the transition from matrix to macropore flow.

The model requires infiltration measurements using tension infiltrometers, rainfall simulators, and dye tracing experiments paired with detailed surface and profile characterization. USDA-NRCS has infiltration data from soil surveys but lacks process detail. New protocols should combine time-lapse electrical resistivity tomography with infiltration tests to track three-dimensional flow patterns.
