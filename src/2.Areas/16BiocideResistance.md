# **16. BiocideResistance**
This model forecasts the evolution and spread of pesticide resistance in soil microbiomes, predicting community resilience to chemical stressors. It learns resistance mechanisms from genomic data and predicts cross-resistance patterns.

Training needs before/after pesticide application sampling, resistance gene quantification, and pesticide degradation rate measurements. The Pesticide Properties Database has chemical information but lacks microbiome responses. Future collection should track community changes over multiple pesticide applications with functional metagenomics.
