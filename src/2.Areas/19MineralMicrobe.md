# **19. MineralMicrobe**
This model predicts microbe-mineral interactions affecting weathering rates, nutrient release, and organic matter stabilization. It learns mineral preferences of different organisms and resulting transformation rates.

The model requires paired mineralogical analysis (XRD, SEM), microbial community profiling on mineral surfaces, and weathering rate measurements. The Deep Carbon Observatory has some deep subsurface data but soil-specific datasets are limited. New collection should use mineral-amended microcosms with time-series sampling and synchrotron-based mineral characterization.
