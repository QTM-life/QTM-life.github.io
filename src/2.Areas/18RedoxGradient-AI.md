This model predicts oxygen distribution and alternative electron acceptor availability in soil aggregates and profiles, forecasting anaerobic microsites and their biogeochemical impacts. It integrates diffusion physics with microbial consumption rates.

Training data needs microelectrode measurements of Oâ‚‚, microsensor data for other electron acceptors, and corresponding microbial community analysis. Some data exists from wetland studies but upland soil coverage is poor. Future efforts should employ planar optodes for 2D oxygen imaging with parallel sequencing of adjacent samples.
