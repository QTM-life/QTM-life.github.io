# **20. PrimeDecomposer**
This model predicts priming effects where fresh organic inputs accelerate or retard decomposition of existing soil organic matter. It learns to identify conditions and inputs that trigger positive or negative priming.

Training needs ¹³C-labeled substrate additions with partitioned respiration measurements, enzyme activities, and microbial community shifts. Various isotope studies exist but lack standardization. Future experiments should use position-specific labeling to track metabolic pathways and continuous CO₂ isotope monitoring.
