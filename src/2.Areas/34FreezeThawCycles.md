# **34. FreezeThawCycles**
This model forecasts the impacts of freezing and thawing on soil structure, predicting changes in aggregate stability, hydraulic properties, and carbon mineralization. It learns critical conditions for ice lens formation and structural reformation.

Building this requires controlled freeze-thaw experiments with monitoring of unfrozen water content, aggregate size distributions, and COâ‚‚ flux. Permafrost research networks have some data but temperate soil coverage is limited. Future collection should use impedance spectroscopy to track ice formation with parallel structural and biological measurements.
