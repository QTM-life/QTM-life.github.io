# **17. SyntrophicNetworks**
This model predicts the establishment and stability of syntrophic relationships where multiple organisms cooperate to degrade complex compounds. It identifies potential partners and predicts degradation rates for recalcitrant substrates.

Building this requires co-culture experiments, metabolic modeling, and in situ visualization of spatial associations. The Syntrophy Database has some characterized partnerships but soil-specific data is scarce. New methods should use NanoSIMS to track metabolite exchange between adjacent cells in soil aggregates.
