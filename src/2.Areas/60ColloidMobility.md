### **60. ColloidMobility**
This model predicts the generation, stability, and transport of soil colloids that carry nutrients and contaminants. It learns effects of solution chemistry and flow rates on colloid mobilization.

Training data needs particle size analysis of soil solutions, zeta potential measurements, and column transport experiments. Limited field-scale colloid transport data exists. Future efforts should use single particle ICP-MS to track colloid composition during transport experiments.

### **61. RedoxPoising**
This model forecasts redox buffering capacity and the sequence of electron acceptor utilization during reduction. It learns redox ladder progression from mineralogy and organic matter quality.

The model requires redox potential monitoring, electron accepting capacity measurements, and identification of redox-active phases. Wetland studies have extensive data but upland soil redox dynamics are poorly characterized. New methods should use mediated electrochemistry to quantify electron accepting/donating capacity.

### **62. MicronutrientCycling**
This model predicts trace element (Zn, Cu, Mn, B, Mo) availability from total contents, accounting for pH, organic matter, and competitive interactions. It learns plant-available pools from different extraction methods.

Building this needs multi-element extractions, plant tissue analysis, and pot trials with micronutrient additions. Soil testing services have data but extraction methods vary widely. Future collection should standardize on DGT measurements with validation against plant uptake.

### **63. AllelopathyPredictor**
This model forecasts the production, accumulation, and degradation of plant-produced toxins that inhibit other plants. It learns persistence of different allelochemicals and their effects on seed germination and growth.

Training requires identification of allelochemicals using LC-MS, soil bioassays, and field observations of plant interactions. Limited systematic data exists on allelochemical fate in soil. New studies should track specific compounds using isotope labeling with parallel bioassays.

### **64. PesticideFate**
This model predicts pesticide degradation pathways, half-lives, and metabolite formation under varying conditions. It learns effects of soil properties and microbial communities on persistence.

The model needs pesticide dissipation studies, metabolite identification, and measurements of bound residues. The Pesticide Properties Database has laboratory data but field validation is limited. Future efforts should use ¹⁴C-labeled pesticides with position-specific labeling to track complete fate.

### **65. RadiocarbonAge**
This model forecasts carbon turnover times in different soil pools using radiocarbon signatures. It learns to partition bulk soil carbon into pools with distinct residence times.

Building this requires radiocarbon dating of bulk soil and fractions, combined with modeling of bomb-carbon incorporation. Limited facilities can measure radiocarbon and costs are high. New strategies should focus on compound-specific radiocarbon analysis to resolve individual molecule ages.

## **Ecosystem & Landscape Processes (66-85)**

### **66. CarbonSequestrator**
This model optimizes management strategies for maximum soil carbon storage, predicting sequestration potential under different practices. It learns interactions between inputs, decomposition, and stabilization mechanisms across soil types and climates.

Training this model requires long-term carbon stock measurements under diverse management, isotopic partitioning of new versus old carbon, and deep soil sampling to 1+ meter. The Soil Health Institute and various LTER sites have management trials but deep carbon data is often missing. Future collection should establish paired chronosequences with eddy covariance towers for continuous CO₂ monitoring and periodic deep coring.

### **67. NutrientBudget-Regional**
This model predicts watershed-scale nutrient balances, tracking inputs, transformations, and exports through landscapes. It learns how topography, land use, and hydrology control nutrient redistribution from hillslopes to streams.

Building this requires stream water quality monitoring, spatially distributed soil sampling, and atmospheric deposition measurements across watersheds. The National Water Quality Monitoring Council has stream data but linkage to soil processes is weak. New strategies should deploy sensor networks for continuous nutrient monitoring with periodic synoptic sampling campaigns during storm events.

### **68. DesertGreenShield**
This model forecasts biological soil crust development in arid lands, predicting succession from cyanobacteria to mosses and impacts on erosion resistance. It learns environmental triggers for crust establishment and recovery after disturbance.

Training data needs crust composition surveys, chlorophyll measurements, surface stability tests, and monitoring of recovery trajectories. The USGS Canyonlands Research Station has extensive crust data but coverage of global drylands is limited. Future efforts should use hyperspectral imaging to map crust types with field validation and controlled disturbance experiments.

### **69. WetlandSoilGen**
This model predicts hydric soil development and biogeochemical cycling in wetlands, forecasting methane emissions and carbon burial rates. It learns relationships between hydroperiod, plant communities, and soil formation.

The model requires water table monitoring, redox measurements, greenhouse gas fluxes, and soil carbon accumulation rates. The National Wetlands Research Center has some data but process measurements are fragmented. New protocols should install automated chambers with multi-gas analysis and continuous redox/pH monitoring.
