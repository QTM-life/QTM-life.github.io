# **10. ExopolymerMatrix**
This model predicts microbial production of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) that bind soil particles into aggregates, forecasting aggregate stability from microbial community data. It learns relationships between environmental stress, community composition, and EPS production.

Training data needs measurements of EPS composition (polysaccharides, proteins, DNA), aggregate stability tests, and microbial community profiling. Limited datasets exist linking EPS chemistry to aggregate formation. Future collection should use lectin-binding assays and confocal microscopy to map EPS distribution in aggregates.
