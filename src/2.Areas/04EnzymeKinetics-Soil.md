# **4. EnzymeKinetics-Soil**
This model predicts extracellular enzyme production and activity rates under varying temperature, moisture, pH, and substrate availability, enabling forecast of decomposition rates and nutrient mineralization. It learns the complex regulatory networks controlling enzyme expression and the effects of environmental factors on enzyme stability and kinetics.

Training requires high-frequency measurements of multiple enzyme activities paired with detailed environmental monitoring and substrate availability assessments. The Enzymes in the Environment Research Coordination Network has compiled enzyme activity data from hundreds of studies, though standardization remains challenging. Future data collection should employ continuous fluorometric monitoring in field conditions using embedded microsensors to capture temporal dynamics.
