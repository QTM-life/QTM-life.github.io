# **21. BiocharColonizer**
This model predicts microbial colonization patterns and community assembly on biochar particles, forecasting functional changes over time. It learns surface property preferences and succession dynamics.

Building this requires time-series sampling of biochar-amended soils, SEM imaging of colonization, and pore-scale community analysis. The International Biochar Initiative has amendment studies but detailed colonization data is rare. New methods should use FISH-SIMS to identify specific colonizers and their metabolic activity on biochar surfaces.
