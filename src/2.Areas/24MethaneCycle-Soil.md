# **24. MethaneCycle-Soil**
This model predicts methane production and consumption in upland and wetland soils, forecasting net CH₄ fluxes under changing conditions. It integrates methanogen and methanotroph abundance with environmental controls.

Training needs CH₄ flux measurements, pmoA/mcrA gene quantification, and porewater chemistry profiles. The Global Methane Budget project compiles flux data but lacks corresponding microbial information. Future collection should use automated chambers with laser spectroscopy and parallel DNA/RNA sampling.
