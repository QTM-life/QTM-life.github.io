# **33. ThermalRegime**
This model predicts soil temperature profiles and heat flux under varying atmospheric conditions and vegetation cover. It learns thermal property changes with moisture and the effects of management on soil temperature dynamics.

Training data needs continuous multi-depth temperature monitoring, thermal property measurements, and surface energy balance data. The Soil Climate Analysis Network provides temperature data but thermal properties are rarely measured. New instrumentation should integrate heat pulse sensors for in situ thermal property determination with standard temperature monitoring.
