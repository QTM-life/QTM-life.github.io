# **6. PhosphoCycle-AI**
This model predicts phosphorus availability and mobilization through both geochemical and biological pathways, forecasting plant-available P from total P pools. It integrates mineral dissolution kinetics, organic P mineralization, and microbial P solubilization mechanisms.

Training data must include sequential P extraction data, phosphatase enzyme activities, P-solubilizing microorganism abundance, and plant P uptake measurements. The International Phosphorus Institute maintains some datasets, but comprehensive biological-chemical integration is rare. Future collection should use ³¹P NMR spectroscopy to characterize organic P forms alongside metagenomic sequencing for P-cycling genes.
