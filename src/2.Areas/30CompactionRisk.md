# **30. CompactionRisk**
This model predicts soil susceptibility to compaction from machinery and livestock traffic, forecasting changes in bulk density and pore structure. It learns critical moisture contents for compaction and recovery potential through freeze-thaw and shrink-swell cycles.

Building this requires Proctor compaction tests, precompression stress measurements, and field traffic experiments with penetrometer mapping. Agricultural engineering departments have machinery impact data but often lack soil recovery monitoring. Future studies should use embedded sensors to track bulk density changes over multiple seasons following compaction events.
