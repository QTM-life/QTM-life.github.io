# **14. HorizontalGeneFlow**
This model predicts rates and patterns of horizontal gene transfer in soil communities, forecasting the spread of functional traits like antibiotic resistance or degradation capabilities. It identifies transfer hotspots and environmental conditions promoting gene exchange.

Training data needs metagenomic assemblies to identify mobile genetic elements, conjugation gene expression data, and experimental transfer rates. The Mobile Genetic Elements Database catalogs sequences but lacks environmental context. Future work should use fluorescent reporter systems to track real-time transfer events in soil microcosms.
