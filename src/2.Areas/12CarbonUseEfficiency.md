### **12. CarbonUseEfficiency**
This model predicts microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) - the fraction of consumed carbon converted to biomass versus respired as CO₂ - under varying environmental conditions and substrate qualities. It learns how temperature, moisture, and nutrient availability affect the balance between growth and maintenance metabolism.

Training requires simultaneous measurements of microbial growth (via ¹⁸O-water labeling), respiration, and environmental conditions across gradients. The Microbial Carbon Use Efficiency Database has some data but coverage is limited. Future collection should employ continuous respiration monitoring with periodic biomass sampling using chloroform fumigation or substrate-independent methods.
