# **22. AntibioticResistome**
This model tracks antibiotic resistance gene abundance and diversity in agricultural soils, predicting risks of resistance transfer to pathogens. It learns associations between management practices and resistance gene proliferation.

Training data needs comprehensive resistance gene screening, mobile element identification, and antibiotic residue measurements. The CARD database catalogs resistance genes but soil-specific prevalence data is fragmented. Future collection should employ long-read sequencing to link resistance genes with mobile elements and host organisms.
