# **37. TillageImpact**
This model forecasts long-term effects of different tillage systems on soil structure, predicting changes in pore networks, aggregate stability, and stratification. It learns recovery trajectories following tillage and optimal timing for operations.

Building this requires long-term tillage experiments with annual structural assessments, penetration resistance mapping, and pore characterization. Various agricultural research stations maintain tillage trials but detailed structural monitoring is rare. New protocols should use in-field CT scanning to track structural evolution without disturbing experiments.
