# **9. ProtistPredictor**
This model forecasts soil protist community composition and their impacts on bacterial populations through predation, affecting nutrient mineralization and carbon cycling. It predicts selective grazing patterns and resulting changes in bacterial community function.

Building this requires 18S rRNA sequencing for protists paired with bacterial community analysis and grazing rate measurements using fluorescently labeled bacteria. The Protist Diversity Database has taxonomic information but lacks functional data. New protocols should employ single-cell sequencing to identify protist gut contents and quantify grazing preferences.
