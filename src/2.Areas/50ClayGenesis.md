### **50. ClayGenesis**
This model forecasts secondary clay mineral formation pathways and rates, predicting the evolution of cation exchange capacity and water retention. It learns transformation sequences from primary minerals to different clay types.

Building this needs detailed clay mineralogy using XRD with oriented samples, TEM imaging, and solution chemistry of weathering environments. Soil genesis studies provide snapshots but transformation rates are poorly constrained. Future collection should use synthesis experiments under controlled conditions with isotopic tracers to track Si and Al incorporation.

### **51. IronRedox**
This model predicts iron oxidation-reduction dynamics and impacts on phosphorus availability, aggregate stability, and carbon protection. It learns Fe phase transformations under fluctuating redox conditions.

Training requires Fe extraction by multiple methods, Mössbauer spectroscopy for Fe phases, and monitoring of Fe²⁺/Fe³⁺ during redox cycles. Wetland studies have redox data but upland soil dynamics are understudied. New methods should use microelectrodes for real-time redox monitoring with X-ray absorption spectroscopy for Fe speciation.

### **52. AluminumToxicity**
This model forecasts aluminum speciation and plant toxicity risk in acid soils, predicting Al³⁺ activity from pH, organic matter, and base saturation. It learns critical thresholds for different plant species and amelioration strategies.

The model needs Al fractionation data, solution Al³⁺ measurements, and plant response trials at different Al levels. Acid soil research has scattered data but lacks integration. Future efforts should use ion-selective electrodes for Al³⁺ with rhizotron studies of root response to Al gradients.

### **53. HeavyMetalSpeciation**
This model predicts trace element partitioning between solution, exchangeable, and bound phases, forecasting bioavailability and mobility. It learns how pH, organic matter, and competing ions affect metal speciation.

Building this requires sequential extraction procedures, diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) measurements, and plant uptake studies. Contaminated site assessments have data but background soil coverage is poor. New protocols should combine DGT with micro-XRF mapping to link speciation to spatial distribution.

### **54. SulfurTransformations**
This model forecasts sulfur cycling including mineralization, oxidation, and reduction, predicting sulfate availability and acid generation potential. It learns S transformation rates from microbial communities and environmental conditions.

Training data needs total S, sulfate, and organic S measurements, sulfur isotope analysis, and monitoring during wetting-drying cycles. Limited integrated S cycling data exists for non-wetland soils. Future collection should use S isotopes to trace transformations with parallel sequencing of S-cycling genes.

### **55. CarbonateEquilibrium**
This model predicts carbonate dissolution-precipitation dynamics, CO₂ fluxes, and pH buffering in calcareous soils. It learns kinetic constraints on equilibrium under field conditions.

The model requires carbonate content, CO₂ partial pressure measurements, and solution chemistry including alkalinity. Arid land studies have some data but reaction kinetics are poorly constrained. New methods should use in situ pH and CO₂ microsensors with isotopic tracing of carbonate dissolution.

### **56. SilicaCycling**
This model forecasts silicon availability and phytolith formation, important for plant health and long-term carbon sequestration. It learns Si dissolution from minerals and precipitation in plant tissues.

Building this needs Si extraction procedures, phytolith analysis, and plant Si content measurements. Limited data exists on Si cycling in agricultural soils. Future efforts should track Si isotopes from minerals through plants with electron microscopy of phytolith formation.

### **57. HumicEvolution**
This model predicts the formation and transformation of humic substances, learning molecular structures that confer recalcitrance. It forecasts changes in humic composition under different management.

Training requires advanced characterization using techniques like FT-ICR-MS, NMR spectroscopy, and size exclusion chromatography. The International Humic Substances Society has standard materials but field sample data is limited. New strategies should use ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry with ¹³C labeling to track humic formation pathways.

### **58. CharDecomposition**
This model predicts biochar aging, functionalization, and integration into soil organic matter over decades. It learns surface chemistry changes and interactions with minerals and microbes.

The model needs aged biochar samples from long-term field trials, surface characterization using XPS and FTIR, and incubation studies. The International Biochar Initiative has some aged samples but systematic studies are rare. Future collection should establish chronosequences with periodic sampling for comprehensive characterization.

### **59. NutrientSorption**
This model forecasts competitive sorption of nutrients and contaminants on soil surfaces, predicting availability and leaching risk. It learns multi-component isotherms and kinetics from batch and column experiments.

Building this requires extensive isotherm data for multiple elements, surface complexation modeling parameters, and spectroscopic verification of binding mechanisms. Scattered data exists but multi-component systems are understudied. New experiments should use flow-through reactors with real-time monitoring and surface spectroscopy.
