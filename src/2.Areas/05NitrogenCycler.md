# **5. NitrogenCycler**
This model provides complete prediction of nitrogen transformations including mineralization, nitrification, denitrification, and N₂O emissions based on soil properties, microbial communities, and environmental conditions. It integrates gene abundance data (amoA, nirK, nosZ) with process rate measurements to predict nitrogen fate.

Building this model requires datasets combining gross nitrogen transformation rates (measured via ¹⁵N pool dilution), N₂O flux measurements, and quantitative PCR of nitrogen cycling genes. The Global N₂O Database and various LTER sites have extensive process measurements, though few include comprehensive molecular data. New collection strategies should employ automated chamber systems with isotope analyzers to capture high-resolution N₂O dynamics alongside microbial sampling.
