# **1. SoilMetaGen**
This model predicts complete functional potential of soil microbial communities from partial metagenomic sequencing data combined with environmental parameters, enabling cost-effective assessment of soil biological capacity. It learns to infer the presence of uncaptured genes and pathways based on ecological co-occurrence patterns and environmental constraints.

Building SoilMetaGen requires extensive paired datasets of deep metagenomic sequencing and shallow shotgun sequencing from the same soils across diverse ecosystems and management conditions. The Joint Genome Institute and Earth Microbiome Project already maintain large metagenomic databases, though most lack the paired deep/shallow sequencing needed for training. New data collection should focus on creating standardized protocols for gradient sequencing depths across major soil types and land uses.

By learning ecological co-occurrence patterns and environmental constraints, SoilMetaGen enables cost-effective assessment of soil biological capacity through inference of uncaptured genes and pathways. This comprehensive plan outlines the technical architecture, data requirements, implementation strategy, and practical considerations for developing this transformative biological AI system.
