### **11. MetabolicFlux-Soil**
This model reconstructs complete metabolic networks in soil communities, predicting carbon and nutrient flow through microbial food webs. It integrates genome-scale metabolic models of individual organisms into community-level flux predictions.

The model requires metagenome-assembled genomes, metatranscriptomic data, and metabolite measurements under different conditions. The KBase platform provides tools for metabolic modeling but lacks soil-specific training data. New efforts should employ ¹³C-labeled substrates with metabolomics to trace carbon flow through specific pathways.
