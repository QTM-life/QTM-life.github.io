# **35. ShrinkSwellDynamics**
This model predicts volume changes in clay-rich soils during wetting-drying cycles, forecasting crack network development and self-mulching behavior. It learns relationships between clay mineralogy, exchangeable cations, and shrink-swell potential.

Training needs continuous monitoring of soil volume changes using displacement transducers, crack network imaging, and corresponding moisture measurements. The Vertisol research community has scattered datasets but lacks standardization. New methods should employ photogrammetry for 3D surface tracking combined with subsurface moisture sensing.
