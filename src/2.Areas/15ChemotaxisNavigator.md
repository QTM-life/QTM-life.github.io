# **15. ChemotaxisNavigator**
This model predicts bacterial movement toward nutrient sources and root exudates in soil pore networks, affecting colonization patterns and biogeochemical hotspots. It integrates chemotactic gene expression with pore-scale physics.

The model requires microfluidic device experiments tracking bacterial movement, chemoreceptor gene expression data, and chemical gradient measurements. Limited data exists on chemotaxis in realistic soil structures. New experiments should use transparent soil analogs with fluorescent bacteria to observe movement in response to introduced gradients.
