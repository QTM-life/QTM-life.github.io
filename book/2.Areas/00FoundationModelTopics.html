<h2 id="soil-microbiome--molecular-dynamics-1-25"><a class="header" href="#soil-microbiome--molecular-dynamics-1-25"><strong>Soil Microbiome &amp; Molecular Dynamics (1-25)</strong></a></h2>
<h3 id="1-soilmetagen"><a class="header" href="#1-soilmetagen"><strong>1. SoilMetaGen</strong></a></h3>
<p>This model predicts complete functional potential of soil microbial communities from partial metagenomic sequencing data combined with environmental parameters, enabling cost-effective assessment of soil biological capacity. It learns to infer the presence of uncaptured genes and pathways based on ecological co-occurrence patterns and environmental constraints.</p>
<p>Building SoilMetaGen requires extensive paired datasets of deep metagenomic sequencing and shallow shotgun sequencing from the same soils across diverse ecosystems and management conditions. The Joint Genome Institute and Earth Microbiome Project already maintain large metagenomic databases, though most lack the paired deep/shallow sequencing needed for training. New data collection should focus on creating standardized protocols for gradient sequencing depths across major soil types and land uses.</p>
<h3 id="2-rhizospherenet"><a class="header" href="#2-rhizospherenet"><strong>2. RhizosphereNet</strong></a></h3>
<p>This model captures the dynamic interplay between plant roots, soil microbes, and soil organic matter in the rhizosphere, predicting how different plant-microbe combinations affect carbon stabilization and nutrient cycling. It integrates root exudate chemistry, microbial community composition, and soil physical properties to forecast rhizosphere processes.</p>
<p>Training data must include time-resolved sampling of rhizosphere soil with paired measurements of root exudates (collected via root washing or microdialysis), microbial community profiling, and enzyme activities. The Noble Foundation and several USDA Agricultural Research Service locations have rhizosphere sampling programs, though most lack comprehensive exudate characterization. Future collection efforts should employ stable isotope labeling to track carbon flow from roots through microbial communities into soil organic matter pools.</p>
<h3 id="3-mycorrhizalmapper"><a class="header" href="#3-mycorrhizalmapper"><strong>3. MycorrhizalMapper</strong></a></h3>
<p>This model predicts the establishment, extent, and functional capacity of mycorrhizal fungal networks based on plant community composition, soil properties, and management history. It forecasts nutrient transfer rates between plants and identifies conditions that promote extensive hyphal networks for soil aggregation.</p>
<p>The model requires datasets combining molecular identification of mycorrhizal fungi (via ITS sequencing), hyphal length measurements, and nutrient transfer rates measured using isotope tracers. The International Collection of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi and various forest ecology networks have taxonomic data, but few studies measure functional attributes like nutrient transfer. New data collection should use quantum dot labeling and microfluidic soil chips to observe hyphal networks and nutrient flows in real-time.</p>
<h3 id="4-enzymekinetics-soil"><a class="header" href="#4-enzymekinetics-soil"><strong>4. EnzymeKinetics-Soil</strong></a></h3>
<p>This model predicts extracellular enzyme production and activity rates under varying temperature, moisture, pH, and substrate availability, enabling forecast of decomposition rates and nutrient mineralization. It learns the complex regulatory networks controlling enzyme expression and the effects of environmental factors on enzyme stability and kinetics.</p>
<p>Training requires high-frequency measurements of multiple enzyme activities paired with detailed environmental monitoring and substrate availability assessments. The Enzymes in the Environment Research Coordination Network has compiled enzyme activity data from hundreds of studies, though standardization remains challenging. Future data collection should employ continuous fluorometric monitoring in field conditions using embedded microsensors to capture temporal dynamics.</p>
<h3 id="5-nitrogencycler"><a class="header" href="#5-nitrogencycler"><strong>5. NitrogenCycler</strong></a></h3>
<p>This model provides complete prediction of nitrogen transformations including mineralization, nitrification, denitrification, and N₂O emissions based on soil properties, microbial communities, and environmental conditions. It integrates gene abundance data (amoA, nirK, nosZ) with process rate measurements to predict nitrogen fate.</p>
<p>Building this model requires datasets combining gross nitrogen transformation rates (measured via ¹⁵N pool dilution), N₂O flux measurements, and quantitative PCR of nitrogen cycling genes. The Global N₂O Database and various LTER sites have extensive process measurements, though few include comprehensive molecular data. New collection strategies should employ automated chamber systems with isotope analyzers to capture high-resolution N₂O dynamics alongside microbial sampling.</p>
<h3 id="6-phosphocycle-ai"><a class="header" href="#6-phosphocycle-ai"><strong>6. PhosphoCycle-AI</strong></a></h3>
<p>This model predicts phosphorus availability and mobilization through both geochemical and biological pathways, forecasting plant-available P from total P pools. It integrates mineral dissolution kinetics, organic P mineralization, and microbial P solubilization mechanisms.</p>
<p>Training data must include sequential P extraction data, phosphatase enzyme activities, P-solubilizing microorganism abundance, and plant P uptake measurements. The International Phosphorus Institute maintains some datasets, but comprehensive biological-chemical integration is rare. Future collection should use ³¹P NMR spectroscopy to characterize organic P forms alongside metagenomic sequencing for P-cycling genes.</p>
<h3 id="7-quorumsense-soil"><a class="header" href="#7-quorumsense-soil"><strong>7. QuorumSense-Soil</strong></a></h3>
<p>This model predicts bacterial communication networks and resulting community behaviors like biofilm formation, antibiotic production, and coordinated enzyme secretion. It learns to identify quorum sensing signals from metabolomic data and predict community-level responses.</p>
<p>The model requires paired metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and metabolomics data with specific focus on acyl-homoserine lactones and other signaling molecules. Few existing datasets comprehensively measure signaling molecules in soil; most research focuses on pure cultures. New data collection should employ solid-phase microextraction coupled with mass spectrometry to detect signaling molecules in soil microsites.</p>
<h3 id="8-viralshunt"><a class="header" href="#8-viralshunt"><strong>8. ViralShunt</strong></a></h3>
<p>This model predicts viral abundance, host range, and impacts on microbial turnover and nutrient cycling in soil, quantifying the "viral shunt" that redirects carbon and nutrients. It learns virus-host relationships from metagenomic data and predicts lysis rates under different conditions.</p>
<p>Training requires virome sequencing paired with bacterial/archaeal community profiling and measurements of cell lysis rates. The IMG/VR database contains soil viral sequences but lacks corresponding host and process data. Future collection should use fluorescent staining and flow cytometry to quantify viral production rates alongside sequencing efforts.</p>
<h3 id="9-protistpredictor"><a class="header" href="#9-protistpredictor"><strong>9. ProtistPredictor</strong></a></h3>
<p>This model forecasts soil protist community composition and their impacts on bacterial populations through predation, affecting nutrient mineralization and carbon cycling. It predicts selective grazing patterns and resulting changes in bacterial community function.</p>
<p>Building this requires 18S rRNA sequencing for protists paired with bacterial community analysis and grazing rate measurements using fluorescently labeled bacteria. The Protist Diversity Database has taxonomic information but lacks functional data. New protocols should employ single-cell sequencing to identify protist gut contents and quantify grazing preferences.</p>
<h3 id="10-exopolymermatrix"><a class="header" href="#10-exopolymermatrix"><strong>10. ExopolymerMatrix</strong></a></h3>
<p>This model predicts microbial production of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) that bind soil particles into aggregates, forecasting aggregate stability from microbial community data. It learns relationships between environmental stress, community composition, and EPS production.</p>
<p>Training data needs measurements of EPS composition (polysaccharides, proteins, DNA), aggregate stability tests, and microbial community profiling. Limited datasets exist linking EPS chemistry to aggregate formation. Future collection should use lectin-binding assays and confocal microscopy to map EPS distribution in aggregates.</p>
<h3 id="11-metabolicflux-soil"><a class="header" href="#11-metabolicflux-soil"><strong>11. MetabolicFlux-Soil</strong></a></h3>
<p>This model reconstructs complete metabolic networks in soil communities, predicting carbon and nutrient flow through microbial food webs. It integrates genome-scale metabolic models of individual organisms into community-level flux predictions.</p>
<p>The model requires metagenome-assembled genomes, metatranscriptomic data, and metabolite measurements under different conditions. The KBase platform provides tools for metabolic modeling but lacks soil-specific training data. New efforts should employ ¹³C-labeled substrates with metabolomics to trace carbon flow through specific pathways.</p>
<h3 id="12-carbonuseefficiency"><a class="header" href="#12-carbonuseefficiency"><strong>12. CarbonUseEfficiency</strong></a></h3>
<p>This model predicts microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) - the fraction of consumed carbon converted to biomass versus respired as CO₂ - under varying environmental conditions and substrate qualities. It learns how temperature, moisture, and nutrient availability affect the balance between growth and maintenance metabolism.</p>
<p>Training requires simultaneous measurements of microbial growth (via ¹⁸O-water labeling), respiration, and environmental conditions across gradients. The Microbial Carbon Use Efficiency Database has some data but coverage is limited. Future collection should employ continuous respiration monitoring with periodic biomass sampling using chloroform fumigation or substrate-independent methods.</p>
<h3 id="13-dormancydynamics"><a class="header" href="#13-dormancydynamics"><strong>13. DormancyDynamics</strong></a></h3>
<p>This model predicts transitions between active and dormant states in soil microbial communities, forecasting the responsive fraction under changing conditions. It learns triggers for dormancy induction and resuscitation from environmental time series.</p>
<p>Building this requires RNA/DNA ratios to assess activity, BONCAT labeling to identify active cells, and high-frequency environmental monitoring. Few studies track dormancy dynamics over time; most are snapshots. New approaches should combine flow cytometry with viability staining and metatranscriptomics during wetting-drying cycles.</p>
<h3 id="14-horizontalgeneflow"><a class="header" href="#14-horizontalgeneflow"><strong>14. HorizontalGeneFlow</strong></a></h3>
<p>This model predicts rates and patterns of horizontal gene transfer in soil communities, forecasting the spread of functional traits like antibiotic resistance or degradation capabilities. It identifies transfer hotspots and environmental conditions promoting gene exchange.</p>
<p>Training data needs metagenomic assemblies to identify mobile genetic elements, conjugation gene expression data, and experimental transfer rates. The Mobile Genetic Elements Database catalogs sequences but lacks environmental context. Future work should use fluorescent reporter systems to track real-time transfer events in soil microcosms.</p>
<h3 id="15-chemotaxisnavigator"><a class="header" href="#15-chemotaxisnavigator"><strong>15. ChemotaxisNavigator</strong></a></h3>
<p>This model predicts bacterial movement toward nutrient sources and root exudates in soil pore networks, affecting colonization patterns and biogeochemical hotspots. It integrates chemotactic gene expression with pore-scale physics.</p>
<p>The model requires microfluidic device experiments tracking bacterial movement, chemoreceptor gene expression data, and chemical gradient measurements. Limited data exists on chemotaxis in realistic soil structures. New experiments should use transparent soil analogs with fluorescent bacteria to observe movement in response to introduced gradients.</p>
<h3 id="16-biocideresistance"><a class="header" href="#16-biocideresistance"><strong>16. BiocideResistance</strong></a></h3>
<p>This model forecasts the evolution and spread of pesticide resistance in soil microbiomes, predicting community resilience to chemical stressors. It learns resistance mechanisms from genomic data and predicts cross-resistance patterns.</p>
<p>Training needs before/after pesticide application sampling, resistance gene quantification, and pesticide degradation rate measurements. The Pesticide Properties Database has chemical information but lacks microbiome responses. Future collection should track community changes over multiple pesticide applications with functional metagenomics.</p>
<h3 id="17-syntrophicnetworks"><a class="header" href="#17-syntrophicnetworks"><strong>17. SyntrophicNetworks</strong></a></h3>
<p>This model predicts the establishment and stability of syntrophic relationships where multiple organisms cooperate to degrade complex compounds. It identifies potential partners and predicts degradation rates for recalcitrant substrates.</p>
<p>Building this requires co-culture experiments, metabolic modeling, and in situ visualization of spatial associations. The Syntrophy Database has some characterized partnerships but soil-specific data is scarce. New methods should use NanoSIMS to track metabolite exchange between adjacent cells in soil aggregates.</p>
<h3 id="18-redoxgradient-ai"><a class="header" href="#18-redoxgradient-ai"><strong>18. RedoxGradient-AI</strong></a></h3>
<p>This model predicts oxygen distribution and alternative electron acceptor availability in soil aggregates and profiles, forecasting anaerobic microsites and their biogeochemical impacts. It integrates diffusion physics with microbial consumption rates.</p>
<p>Training data needs microelectrode measurements of O₂, microsensor data for other electron acceptors, and corresponding microbial community analysis. Some data exists from wetland studies but upland soil coverage is poor. Future efforts should employ planar optodes for 2D oxygen imaging with parallel sequencing of adjacent samples.</p>
<h3 id="19-mineralmicrobe"><a class="header" href="#19-mineralmicrobe"><strong>19. MineralMicrobe</strong></a></h3>
<p>This model predicts microbe-mineral interactions affecting weathering rates, nutrient release, and organic matter stabilization. It learns mineral preferences of different organisms and resulting transformation rates.</p>
<p>The model requires paired mineralogical analysis (XRD, SEM), microbial community profiling on mineral surfaces, and weathering rate measurements. The Deep Carbon Observatory has some deep subsurface data but soil-specific datasets are limited. New collection should use mineral-amended microcosms with time-series sampling and synchrotron-based mineral characterization.</p>
<h3 id="20-primedecomposer"><a class="header" href="#20-primedecomposer"><strong>20. PrimeDecomposer</strong></a></h3>
<p>This model predicts priming effects where fresh organic inputs accelerate or retard decomposition of existing soil organic matter. It learns to identify conditions and inputs that trigger positive or negative priming.</p>
<p>Training needs ¹³C-labeled substrate additions with partitioned respiration measurements, enzyme activities, and microbial community shifts. Various isotope studies exist but lack standardization. Future experiments should use position-specific labeling to track metabolic pathways and continuous CO₂ isotope monitoring.</p>
<h3 id="21-biocharcolonizer"><a class="header" href="#21-biocharcolonizer"><strong>21. BiocharColonizer</strong></a></h3>
<p>This model predicts microbial colonization patterns and community assembly on biochar particles, forecasting functional changes over time. It learns surface property preferences and succession dynamics.</p>
<p>Building this requires time-series sampling of biochar-amended soils, SEM imaging of colonization, and pore-scale community analysis. The International Biochar Initiative has amendment studies but detailed colonization data is rare. New methods should use FISH-SIMS to identify specific colonizers and their metabolic activity on biochar surfaces.</p>
<h3 id="22-antibioticresistome"><a class="header" href="#22-antibioticresistome"><strong>22. AntibioticResistome</strong></a></h3>
<p>This model tracks antibiotic resistance gene abundance and diversity in agricultural soils, predicting risks of resistance transfer to pathogens. It learns associations between management practices and resistance gene proliferation.</p>
<p>Training data needs comprehensive resistance gene screening, mobile element identification, and antibiotic residue measurements. The CARD database catalogs resistance genes but soil-specific prevalence data is fragmented. Future collection should employ long-read sequencing to link resistance genes with mobile elements and host organisms.</p>
<h3 id="23-fungalhighway"><a class="header" href="#23-fungalhighway"><strong>23. FungalHighway</strong></a></h3>
<p>This model predicts bacterial dispersal along fungal hyphae networks, forecasting enhanced degradation of spatially separated pollutants. It learns which bacterial-fungal pairs form effective partnerships for contaminant degradation.</p>
<p>The model requires microscopic tracking of bacterial movement on hyphae, co-inoculation degradation experiments, and network topology analysis. Few studies quantify dispersal rates; most are qualitative observations. New approaches should use microfluidic devices with hyphal networks and fluorescent bacteria to quantify transport rates.</p>
<h3 id="24-methanecycle-soil"><a class="header" href="#24-methanecycle-soil"><strong>24. MethaneCycle-Soil</strong></a></h3>
<p>This model predicts methane production and consumption in upland and wetland soils, forecasting net CH₄ fluxes under changing conditions. It integrates methanogen and methanotroph abundance with environmental controls.</p>
<p>Training needs CH₄ flux measurements, pmoA/mcrA gene quantification, and porewater chemistry profiles. The Global Methane Budget project compiles flux data but lacks corresponding microbial information. Future collection should use automated chambers with laser spectroscopy and parallel DNA/RNA sampling.</p>
<h3 id="25-crypticcarbon"><a class="header" href="#25-crypticcarbon"><strong>25. CrypticCarbon</strong></a></h3>
<p>This model predicts the accessibility and vulnerability of physically protected organic matter to decomposition under changing conditions. It learns relationships between aggregate structure, organic matter chemistry, and decomposition rates.</p>
<p>Building this requires aggregate fractionation with compound-specific isotope analysis, enzyme accessibility assays, and micro-CT imaging. Limited data links physical protection to chemical composition. New methods should use sequential density fractionation with NMR characterization and controlled aggregate disruption experiments.</p>
<h2 id="soil-physics--structure-26-45"><a class="header" href="#soil-physics--structure-26-45"><strong>Soil Physics &amp; Structure (26-45)</strong></a></h2>
<h3 id="26-aggregatearchitect"><a class="header" href="#26-aggregatearchitect"><strong>26. AggregateArchitect</strong></a></h3>
<p>This model predicts the hierarchical formation of soil aggregates from primary particles to large macroaggregates, forecasting aggregate size distributions and stability under different management. It learns the roles of organic binding agents, clay mineralogy, and wetting-drying cycles in aggregate formation.</p>
<p>Training this model requires extensive aggregate fractionation data using methods like wet sieving and slaking tests, paired with organic matter characterization and clay mineral identification.
