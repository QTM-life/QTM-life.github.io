<p>Building a Second Brain (BASB) has sparked renewed interest in personal knowledge management, but it represents just one approach in a rich tradition of information organization systems spanning millennia. The comprehensive survey given below identifies 133 methodologies similar to Tiago Forte's BASB that excel at organizing information for project-based work, drawn from technological, engineering, and scientific domains.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-building-a-second-brain-as-baseline"><a class="header" href="#understanding-building-a-second-brain-as-baseline">Understanding Building a Second Brain as Baseline</a></h2>
<p>Tiago Forte's <a href="https://fortelabs.com/blog/basboverview/"><strong>Building a Second Brain (2022)</strong></a> is based on a very appealling notion, some would say compelling insight, that our brains are fundamentally for having ideas, not really for storing them.</p>
<p>BASB represented a major innovation by synthesizing productivity methodologies with digital note-taking in a way that prioritized actionability over comprehensive capture. Unlike previous systems that emphasized exhaustive documentation (like GTD) or pure linking (like Zettelkasten), BASB introduced the concept of "intermediate packets" that could be immediately useful across projects. This approach solved the common problem of knowledge management systems becoming graveyards of unused information by ensuring every piece of captured information had a clear path to creative output.</p>
<p><a href="https://read.amazon.com/?asin=B09LVVN9L3&amp;ref_=dbs_t_r_khbodl"><strong>Building a Second Brain (2022)</strong></a> operates on the <strong>CODE method</strong> (Capture, Organize, Distill, Express) combined with the <strong>PARA organizational system</strong> (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive). BASB's effectiveness stems from its actionability-focused organization, progressive summarization techniques, and emphasis on creative output rather than passive consumption. The system specifically supports project-based work through "intermediate packets" - discrete, reusable units of work that enable incremental progress and cross-project knowledge transfer.</p>

<p>As we might expect, the digital revolution has spawned numerous sophisticated PKM approaches that are built on BASB's fundamental insight, that our brains are for having ideas, not really for storing or manipulating them. Many of these PKM approaches also implement the core principles of BASB, although they might use their own terminology, ie certainly, not all creators of these PKM approaches read Tiago Forte's book first. After all, anyone could argue that BASB is largely derivative of, or a popular, well-written, well-promoted, best-selling distillation of massive bodies of work in the realm of knowledge engineering.</p>
<h3 id="zettelkasten-and-variants"><a class="header" href="#zettelkasten-and-variants">Zettelkasten and Variants</a></h3>
<p><strong>1. Obsidian Zettelkasten</strong> digitizes Niklas Luhmann's analog slip-box system with bidirectional linking and graph visualization. This implementation revolutionized the traditional Zettelkasten by adding automatic backlink detection and visual knowledge graphs, eliminating the manual cross-referencing burden that limited analog systems. The ability to see connections through graph visualization revealed patterns that were impossible to detect in physical card systems, enabling users to discover unexpected relationships between ideas.</p>
<p><strong>2. Roam Research (2019)</strong> pioneered block-level references and daily notes. Unlike previous wiki-style tools that only linked at the page level, Roam's block references allowed users to transclude and reference individual thoughts across contexts, creating a fluid, non-hierarchical knowledge structure. This innovation eliminated the artificial boundaries between notes and enabled true compound document creation where ideas could live in multiple contexts simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>3. LogSeq</strong> offers local-first, privacy-focused knowledge management with Git integration—particularly appealing to engineers who value version control. LogSeq innovated by combining the block-reference paradigm of Roam with complete data ownership and Git-based version control, addressing privacy concerns that cloud-based alternatives couldn't resolve. This approach represented the first successful marriage of modern PKM features with developer-friendly tooling, enabling engineers to apply software development practices to personal knowledge management.</p>
<p><strong>4. RemNote</strong> introduced spaced repetition directly into note-taking. Unlike previous systems that separated learning from note-taking, RemNote allowed users to create flashcards from their notes automatically using special syntax, integrating memory consolidation into the knowledge capture process. This innovation eliminated the friction between creating study materials and taking notes, making it the first system to truly unite reference material creation with active learning.</p>
<p><strong>5. Notion Databases for PKM</strong> transformed static notes into queryable, relational databases. While earlier tools like Evernote offered tagging and search, Notion introduced database views, filters, and relations that allowed users to create dynamic knowledge systems with multiple perspectives on the same information. This innovation brought database capabilities previously reserved for programmers to general users, enabling complex information architectures without coding.</p>
<h3 id="getting-things-done-adaptations"><a class="header" href="#getting-things-done-adaptations">Getting Things Done Adaptations</a></h3>
<p><strong>6. Digital GTD Implementations</strong> using tools like Todoist and Notion evolved from paper-based systems. These digital adaptations added automated recurring tasks, natural language input, and cross-platform synchronization that paper systems couldn't provide. The innovation lay in maintaining GTD's trusted system principle while adding intelligent features like location-based reminders and project templates that reduced the overhead of system maintenance.</p>
<p><strong>7. GTD + Zettelkasten Hybrid Systems</strong> combine action management with knowledge building. This synthesis addressed GTD's weakness in knowledge retention and Zettelkasten's lack of task management, creating systems where project actions naturally generate reusable knowledge artifacts. The innovation enabled professionals to build expertise while executing projects, rather than treating learning and doing as separate activities.</p>
<p><strong>8. OmniFocus Advanced Perspectives</strong> introduced customizable, saved views of tasks across projects. Unlike simple task lists or even basic GTD implementations, OmniFocus perspectives allowed users to create complex queries that surfaced relevant actions based on multiple criteria simultaneously. This innovation enabled context-switching professionals to instantly reconfigure their task environment for different roles or focus areas.</p>
<h3 id="advanced-digital-systems"><a class="header" href="#advanced-digital-systems">Advanced Digital Systems</a></h3>
<p><strong>9. Andy Matuschak's Evergreen Notes</strong> methodology emphasizes atomic notes with declarative titles that remain permanently valuable across projects. Unlike traditional note-taking that produced time-bound meeting or lecture notes, Evergreen Notes introduced the principle that notes should be written for your future self, with titles that are complete thoughts rather than topics. This innovation shifted note-taking from information storage to knowledge development, where each note became a building block for future thinking.</p>
<p><strong>10. Digital Gardens</strong> popularized by Maggie Appleton, treat knowledge like cultivated spaces with growth stages from "seedlings" to "evergreen" content. Unlike blogs that presented finished thoughts chronologically, Digital Gardens showed thinking in progress with explicit maturity indicators, normalizing learning in public. This innovation removed the pressure for perfection that prevented knowledge sharing and created a new genre of collaborative learning spaces.</p>
<p><strong>11. Foam</strong> brings VSCode-powered knowledge management to developers. By building on VSCode's extension ecosystem, Foam enabled developers to use their existing coding tools and workflows for personal knowledge management. This innovation eliminated the context-switching cost for technical professionals and brought powerful features like multi-cursor editing and regex search to note-taking.</p>
<p><strong>12. Dendron</strong> introduced hierarchical note organization with schema validation. Unlike flat or tag-based systems, Dendron enforced structured hierarchies with schemas that could validate note metadata and relationships. This innovation brought software engineering principles of type safety and validation to personal knowledge management, preventing organizational drift over time.</p>
<p><strong>13. TiddlyWiki</strong> pioneered single-file, self-contained wikis. As one of the earliest personal wiki systems, TiddlyWiki's innovation was packaging an entire wiki system into a single HTML file that could run anywhere without a server. This approach predated cloud storage and enabled truly portable knowledge bases that could be emailed, stored on USB drives, or hosted anywhere.</p>
<h3 id="academic-reference-management-as-pkm"><a class="header" href="#academic-reference-management-as-pkm">Academic Reference Management as PKM</a></h3>
<p><strong>14. Zotero</strong> expanded beyond simple citation management to become a comprehensive research platform. Unlike earlier tools like EndNote that focused solely on bibliography generation, Zotero added web scraping, PDF annotation, and collaborative libraries. This innovation transformed reference management from a final step in writing to an integral part of the research process.</p>
<p><strong>15. Mendeley</strong> added social networking to reference management. By combining citation management with researcher profiles and social features, Mendeley created a research community platform that helped scientists discover relevant work through their network. This innovation addressed the information overload problem by adding social filtering to academic literature discovery.</p>
<p><strong>16. EndNote</strong> pioneered automated citation formatting across thousands of journal styles. Before EndNote, researchers manually formatted references according to each journal's requirements, a time-consuming and error-prone process. EndNote's innovation of style templates and automatic formatting saved researchers countless hours and reduced publication delays due to formatting errors.</p>
<p><strong>17. Papers</strong> (now ReadCube Papers) introduced visual PDF management with enhanced reading features. Unlike traditional reference managers that treated PDFs as attachments, Papers made the reading experience central with features like figure browsing and enhanced PDF viewing. This innovation recognized that modern research happens primarily through PDF consumption rather than physical journal browsing.</p>
<p><strong>18. Citavi</strong> combined reference management with knowledge organization and task planning. Unlike pure citation tools, Citavi added project planning and knowledge categorization features that helped researchers organize thoughts alongside sources. This innovation created the first truly integrated research environment that supported the entire research workflow from literature review to manuscript preparation.</p>
<p><strong>19. JabRef</strong> provided open-source, BibTeX-native reference management. As the first major open-source reference manager, JabRef gave the academic community full control over their bibliographic data without vendor lock-in. This innovation was particularly important for LaTeX users who needed deep BibTeX integration that commercial tools didn't provide.</p>
<p><strong>20. RefWorks</strong> pioneered cloud-based reference management. Before cloud storage became ubiquitous, RefWorks offered web-based reference management that could be accessed from any computer. This innovation freed researchers from single-machine limitations and enabled collaboration before desktop tools added cloud features.</p>
<h2 id="historical-scientific-documentation-methods-18-methodologies"><a class="header" href="#historical-scientific-documentation-methods-18-methodologies">Historical Scientific Documentation Methods (18 Methodologies)</a></h2>
<p>History's greatest scientific minds developed systematic approaches that remain remarkably relevant today:</p>
<p><strong>21. Darwin's Transmutation Notebooks (1837-1859)</strong> used systematic cross-referencing between field observations and theoretical development. Darwin innovated by creating separate notebooks for different aspects of his theory while maintaining elaborate indices that connected observations across volumes and years. This system surpassed the simple chronological journals used by contemporary naturalists by enabling Darwin to synthesize observations made decades apart, a crucial capability for developing evolutionary theory.</p>
<p><strong>22. Einstein's Thought Experiment Documentation</strong> demonstrated systematic recording of "combinatory play" between focused analysis and creative exploration. Unlike the purely mathematical approach of contemporary physicists, Einstein documented imaginative scenarios alongside calculations, creating a new methodology for theoretical physics. His innovation was treating creative visualization as a legitimate scientific tool worthy of systematic documentation, not just mathematical formalism.</p>
<p><strong>23. Einstein's Zurich Notebook (1912-1913)</strong> shows how mathematical calculations interspersed with conceptual insights can develop complex theoretical frameworks. This notebook innovated by documenting failed attempts and wrong turns alongside successful derivations, providing a complete record of the discovery process. Unlike the polished presentations in scientific papers, this approach preserved the actual path to discovery, invaluable for understanding scientific creativity.</p>
<p><strong>24. Leonardo da Vinci's Multi-Topic Integration</strong> used mirror writing across 13,000 pages combining drawings, diagrams, and text. Leonardo's innovation was treating visual and textual information as equally important, using detailed drawings as primary information carriers rather than mere illustrations. This approach transcended the text-dominant scholarship of his era and created a new form of technical documentation that wouldn't be matched until modern CAD systems.</p>
<p><strong>25. Marie Curie's Laboratory Documentation</strong> established meticulous measurement recording and experimental condition tracking. Curie innovated by recording negative results and failed experiments with the same detail as successes, creating comprehensive experimental histories that enabled pattern detection across thousands of trials. Her approach surpassed the selective recording common in contemporary laboratories and established documentation standards still used in modern research.</p>
<p><strong>26. Edison's Invention Factory System</strong> utilized over 3,500 notebooks with systematic dating, signing, and witnessing of entries. Edison's innovation was treating the documentation system itself as a competitive advantage, using witnessed notebooks for patent protection while creating an searchable archive of solutions that could be applied across different inventions. This systematic approach to intellectual property documentation had no precedent in American industry.</p>
<p><strong>27. Newton's Mathematical Notebooks</strong> developed symbolic notation systems that enabled complex calculations. Newton innovated by creating new mathematical notation alongside his discoveries, developing a personal symbol system that made previously impossible calculations tractable. His documentation method unified mathematical development with notation design, unlike contemporaries who worked within existing symbolic constraints.</p>
<p><strong>28. Galileo's Observation Logs</strong> combined quantitative measurements with detailed drawings. Galileo innovated by applying systematic measurement to astronomical observations, recording precise times and angles rather than qualitative descriptions. This quantitative approach to observational astronomy established the template for modern scientific observation records.</p>
<p><strong>29. Kepler's Calculation Notebooks</strong> documented iterative refinement of planetary models. Kepler's innovation was preserving all calculation attempts, creating a record of the iterative approximation process that led to his laws of planetary motion. Unlike contemporaries who only published final results, Kepler's complete documentation revealed the mathematical discovery process itself.</p>
<p><strong>30. Faraday's Laboratory Notebooks</strong> numbered paragraphs continuously across volumes for precise cross-referencing. Faraday innovated by creating a single continuous paragraph numbering system across 30 years of research, enabling instant location of any experimental detail. This system surpassed the volume-based organization of contemporary scientists and created the first truly searchable laboratory archive.</p>
<p><strong>31. Pasteur's Laboratory Protocols</strong> standardized experimental procedures with control documentation. Pasteur innovated by documenting control experiments with equal detail as primary experiments, establishing the modern practice of experimental controls. His meticulous protocol documentation enabled others to reproduce his experiments exactly, revolutionizing biological research methodology.</p>
<p><strong>32. Mendel's Statistical Record-Keeping</strong> for genetic experiments introduced quantitative analysis to biology. Mendel's innovation was applying statistical methods to biological observations, recording precise counts and ratios rather than general descriptions. This mathematical approach to biology had no precedent and established the foundation for modern genetics.</p>
<p><strong>33. Linnaeus's Species Classification System</strong> created hierarchical taxonomies with standardized naming. Linnaeus innovated by replacing lengthy descriptive names with binomial nomenclature and creating a nested hierarchy that could accommodate new discoveries. This system superseded the chaotic naming conventions of earlier naturalists and remains the foundation of biological classification.</p>
<p><strong>34. Humboldt's Integrated Field Studies</strong> combined multiple scientific disciplines in single investigations. Humboldt innovated by documenting connections between geology, biology, meteorology, and human society in unified field studies. His holistic approach transcended the disciplinary boundaries of contemporary science and pioneered the ecological perspective.</p>
<p><strong>35. Hooke's Micrographia Methods</strong> integrated detailed illustration with scientific description. Hooke innovated by making detailed engravings central to scientific communication, not mere decoration. His approach established illustration as a scientific tool equal to text, revolutionizing how microscopic observations were documented and shared.</p>
<p><strong>36. Brahe's Astronomical Data Tables</strong> provided unprecedented observational accuracy. Brahe innovated by achieving and documenting observations accurate to one arcminute, surpassing previous astronomical records by an order of magnitude. His systematic data tables enabled Kepler's later discoveries and established the importance of measurement precision in astronomy.</p>
<p><strong>37. Vesalius's Anatomical Documentation</strong> revolutionized medical illustration accuracy. Vesalius innovated by basing anatomical drawings on direct dissection rather than ancient texts, correcting centuries of errors perpetuated by reliance on Galen. His approach of careful observation over textual authority transformed medical documentation.</p>
<p><strong>38. The Grinnell System (1900s)</strong> used separate field notebooks, journals, and species accounts. Joseph Grinnell innovated by creating a three-tier documentation system that separated immediate observations from analytical notes and systematic catalogs. This approach surpassed the single-notebook methods of earlier naturalists and became the standard for biological field research.</p>
<h2 id="engineering-documentation-systems-18-methodologies"><a class="header" href="#engineering-documentation-systems-18-methodologies">Engineering Documentation Systems (18 Methodologies)</a></h2>
<p>Engineering disciplines have developed sophisticated documentation frameworks essential for complex project management:</p>
<p><strong>39. Standard Laboratory Notebook Practices</strong> provide permanently bound, numbered pages with witness signatures. This system innovated by creating legally defensible documentation for patent claims, replacing loose papers and informal notes that couldn't establish priority. The witnessed notebook became crucial for intellectual property protection in industrial research, a need that didn't exist in academic settings.</p>
<p><strong>40. Electronic Laboratory Notebooks (ELNs)</strong> offer FDA 21 CFR Part 11 compliance with digital signatures. ELNs innovated by maintaining legal compliance while adding search, automatic backup, and integration with laboratory instruments. This advancement over paper notebooks enabled faster drug development and regulatory approval while reducing documentation errors by 70%.</p>
<p><strong>41. CAD File Management Systems</strong> prevent design conflicts through version control. These systems innovated by applying software version control principles to mechanical design, enabling parallel development on complex products.

<p>PERSONAL knowledge management is fundamentally very much PERSONAL ... and thus <strong>extremely</strong> subjective. Thus, inclusion on the above list is something that is subjective and very debatable ... thus the list below is also worth at least a casual glance.</p>
<p>Of course, different people will have different learning and knowledge processing styles. Almost all, tend to HEAVILY favor never tinkering with what works.  Most people thoroughly <strong>OWN</strong> their personal knowledge approach; they are not going to get rid of what they OWN and depend upon -- so they will continue manage their knowledge with technology that they are very comfortable with and already using.</p>
<p>Recognizing this subjectivity, we have a supplemental list of notable Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) systems, platforms, and methodologies that were not on the first list of PKM system, but perhaps, according to some, <em>should</em> have made the top 100. Some on this list are almost violent reactions AGAINST what might be seen as a dominant trend in our culture as embodied by the underlying premises of BASB or anything digital. For example, the paper-based backlash will definitely appeal to old geezers who are "<em>just tired of all this new technology" ... and need to lie down and take a nap!</em></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Antinet Zettelkasten (Scott Scheper)</strong> – Analog-first Zettelkasten revival, positioned explicitly <em>against</em> the “digital-first” BASB trend. Selling point: forces deep processing via handwriting and physical linking. Omitted likely because it’s a niche, paper-based backlash to digital PKM, but it’s arguably influential for those rejecting app-dependence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Smart Notes Method (Sönke Ahrens)</strong> – Zettelkasten-inspired workflow from <em>How to Take Smart Notes</em>. Key selling point: note-taking as a thinking tool, not a storage archive; emphasizes writing output as the driver of note capture. Possibly omitted because it’s a close cousin to Zettelkasten and often lumped under it—but distinct enough to merit listing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Memex Methodology (Vannevar Bush → Hypothes.is / Memex-inspired tools)</strong> – The original vision for linked personal knowledge bases, predating BASB. Selling point: associative trails for thought, non-hierarchical information retrieval. Missing likely because it’s more a theoretical framework than a modern packaged “method.”</p>

<ol start="4">
<li>
<p><strong>Essence-Driven PKM (Nick Milo’s Linking Your Thinking)</strong> – Rejects PARA rigidity; focuses on “Maps of Content” (MOCs) as emergent, thematic hubs rather than predefined categories. Selling point: organic over prescriptive; opposed to “top-down” structure of BASB.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Monocle Method</strong> – Combines time-block journaling with evolving thematic boards. Selling point: more daily-life-centered and reflective than BASB’s project-centric approach. Emerged as a softer alternative for people overwhelmed by PARA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Just-In-Time Knowledge Management</strong> – Workflow where nothing is organized until it’s immediately needed; an anti-BASB stance against “premature organization.” Selling point: reduces system upkeep; appeals to minimalists.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Garden-Stream Dichotomy (Joel Hooks)</strong> – PKM split into two intentionally separate spaces: “stream” for unprocessed capture, “garden” for curated knowledge. Selling point: reduces guilt of “inbox zero” mentality in BASB.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Anti-Notes Movement (Maggie Appleton’s critique)</strong> – Suggests <em>not</em> storing everything; embraces ephemeral thinking, conversation, and synthesis over archival. Selling point: avoids knowledge bloat, encourages active recall.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="other-distinct-modern-pkm-frameworks"><a class="header" href="#other-distinct-modern-pkm-frameworks"><strong>Other Distinct Modern PKM Frameworks</strong></a></h2>
<ol start="9">
<li>
<p><strong>Resonance Calendar</strong> – A hybrid PKM and life-review method that tracks “what resonated” daily, then compiles monthly/quarterly insights. Selling point: emotion-driven indexing over project/task-based organization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quadrant Note-Taking (Four-Square Method)</strong> – Notes divided into Facts, Interpretations, Questions, and Connections. Selling point: forces context and analysis at capture, reducing “cold storage” syndrome.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Second Brain Minimalist (SBM)</strong> – A stripped-down BASB variant where PARA is reduced to only P &amp; A, cutting Resources entirely. Selling point: addresses PARA “Resources graveyard” problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Daily Manifest Method</strong> – Starts with daily intention journaling, links only what’s used that day into persistent knowledge base. Selling point: prevents the “ever-expanding archive” trap.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Collector’s Fallacy Awareness Method</strong> – A meta-method emphasizing awareness of the tendency to over-capture. Selling point: more philosophical, but heavily influences capture discipline.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="older-but-overlooked-pkm-influences"><a class="header" href="#older-but-overlooked-pkm-influences"><strong>Older but Overlooked PKM Influences</strong></a></h2>
<ol start="14">
<li>
<p><strong>Information Foraging Theory (Pirolli &amp; Card)</strong> – Applying ecological foraging models to knowledge-seeking behavior. Selling point: optimizes attention and search paths, relevant for PKM tool design.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cornell Notes with Knowledge Graph Overlay</strong> – Classic lecture-note format combined with modern backlinking. Selling point: merges linear and networked learning styles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>RPG Campaign-Style PKM</strong> – Treats personal knowledge as an ongoing “campaign world” with entities, events, and lore. Selling point: gamifies knowledge building, fosters creativity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sensemaking Loop (Weick)</strong> – Cyclical capture → frame → interpret → act → reframe. Selling point: tightly couples knowledge management with decision-making, not just storage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Narrative-Based PKM</strong> – All notes written as if telling a future story to someone else. Selling point: improves recall and engagement by making knowledge memorable through narrative framing.</p>
